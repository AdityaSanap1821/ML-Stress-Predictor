# ML-Stress-Predictor
Problem Statement:
Stress is a pervasive issue affecting individuals across various demographics in today's fast-paced world. This project aims to address this concern by employing a machine learning approach to predict stress levels based on text data. The objective is to build a predictive model capable of classifying text into either "Stressed" or "Unstressed" categories, providing a tool to assist individuals in managing their stress levels.

Dataset Details:
The dataset used in this project comprises text samples collected from various online platforms. Each sample is labeled as either "Stressed" (1) or "Unstressed" (0) based on its content. The dataset provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating our machine learning models.

Libraries Used:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. seaborn
4. matplotlib
5. sklearn (scikit-learn)
6. textblob
7. nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
8. wordcloud

Model Selection:
1. Multinomial Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree Classifier

Results
The models are evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting stress levels. The results indicate the effectiveness of each model in classifying text into "Stressed" or "Unstressed" categories.

Conclusion
This machine learning project demonstrates an effective approach for predicting stress levels based on text data. By leveraging natural language processing techniques and supervised learning algorithms, we've created models capable of classifying text as "Stressed" or "Unstressed". The models can be deployed for real-time stress level predictions, potentially assisting individuals in managing their stress.
